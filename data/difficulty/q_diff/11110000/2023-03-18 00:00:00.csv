1. The user wants to extract dates and temporal expressions from unstructured German text using Python.
2. They have tried various NLP libraries (spaCy, spaCy_stanza, datefinder, htmldate) but were unable to get them to recognize dates in German text.
3. They noticed that the English spaCy model can recognize dates in both English and German text, but the German spaCy models do not have a specific N"
