1. The user is trying to access Xcom values in a DbtCloudRunJobOperator task.
2. They have defined a function `func` that pushes the Xcom values to the task instance.
3. They are using a PythonOperator to call this function and push the values to Xcom.
4. They want to use these Xcom values in a Jinja template in the DbtCloudRunJobOperator.

The solution involves understanding how to use the `user_defined_macros` parameter in Airflow, how to define custom macros, and how to use them in Jinja templates. It also requires knowledge of how Xcom values are passed between tasks in Airflow.
