5,11110000,2023-05-22,76303458,"Let's break down the question into its components:

1. The user is trying to train a reinforcement learning (RL) agent using stable-baselines3 and is experiencing issues with training due to long execution times and disconnections.
2. They have implemented a checkpointing mechanism to store the model after each training step, but want to know if it's possible to store partial results of the training in batches (e.g., every 100 steps) and continue training from there.
