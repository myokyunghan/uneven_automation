1. The user is asking how to change the colors of multiple Dash charts series.
2. They have a graph that updates based on a dropdown selection, but all the graphs have the same color.
3. They want each graph to have its own unique color.

To solve this problem, we need to understand:

* How Dash works and how to update chart colors dynamically
* How to access and modify the chart's layout and data"
