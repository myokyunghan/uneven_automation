125,11110000,2023-11-25,77549486,"Let's break down the code and analyze its complexity.

The provided code is for a simple calculator application built using Tkinter in Python. The application has buttons for numbers 1-9, basic arithmetic operations (+, -, \*, /), and an equals button to display the result.

Here are some key observations about the code:

*   It uses Tkinter, which is a standard library in Python for creating GUI applications.
*   The code defines multiple functions for handling button clicks, but these functions"
126,11110000,2023-11-25,77549486,"Let's break down the code and analyze its complexity.

1. The code uses Tkinter for creating a GUI calculator, which involves understanding event-driven programming and widget management.
2. It defines multiple functions for handling button clicks, each with specific logic for performing arithmetic operations or updating the display.
3. The code also uses global variables to store intermediate results and operation states, which can make it harder to follow and debug.

Considering these factors, I would rate this question as <Difficulty Level>2"
