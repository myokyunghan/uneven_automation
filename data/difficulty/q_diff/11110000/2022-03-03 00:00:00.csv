When using a certificate with Paramiko, you should load the private key first, then add the certificate to it. However, when you do `pkey.load_certificate('/tmp/kx/id_rsa-cert')`, it's not actually adding the certificate to the private key object.

Instead, you need to create an `RSAKey` object from the private key and then use the `load_certificate` method on that object"
