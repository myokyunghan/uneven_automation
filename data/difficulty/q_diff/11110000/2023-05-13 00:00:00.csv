1. **Understanding of Flask Sessions**: The question involves understanding how sessions work in Flask, which is a fundamental concept but requires some knowledge of web development and Flask specifics.
2. **Debugging Complexity**: The user has already attempted various debugging steps (logging session and request cookies, testing across different browsers) and provided detailed logs, indicating that the issue isn't straightforward or easily solvable with basic troubleshooting.
3. **Integration with External APIs"
