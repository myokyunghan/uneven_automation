1. **Understanding the Question**: The user is experiencing a `RuntimeError` when trying to run an object detection model using MediaPipe after quitting hand landmark detection. They've provided their code and error message, indicating that the issue might be related to the path of the TensorFlow Lite model for person detection.

2. **Technical Complexity**: 
    - The question involves multiple technical components: OpenCV for video capture, MediaPipe for object detection"
