4,11110000,2023-05-15,76250389,"Let's break down the problem and analyze its components:

1. The user is creating a Discord music bot using Python (discord.py) with a queue feature.
2. They want to add tracks to the queue and play them consecutively.
3. The current implementation has issues with playing multiple tracks simultaneously instead of one after another.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the following:

* Understanding of discord.py library and its functionality
* Knowledge of asynchronous programming in Python (asyncio)
