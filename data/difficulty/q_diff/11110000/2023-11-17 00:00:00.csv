5,11110000,2023-11-17,77498941,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm and implement it correctly.

The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a popular cryptographic algorithm that allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel. The algorithm involves the following steps:

1.  **Key Generation**: Both parties agree on a large prime number `p` and a generator `g`. These values are public.
2.  **Private Key Generation**: Each party generates a"

In Diffie-Hellman key exchange, both parties agree on a large prime number `p` and a generator `g`. Each party then generates a private key `a` (or `b`) and calculates their public key as `A = g^a mod p` (or `B = g^b mod p`). The shared secret is then calculated as `K = B^a mod p"
