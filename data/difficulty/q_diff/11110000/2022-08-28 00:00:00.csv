1. **Understanding the Code**: The provided code is a Python program implementing an online shop system with multiple options for users to interact with. It includes functions for displaying available services, searching for services, purchasing services, and viewing past purchases.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: The specific issue here involves the `fourth_option` function, which is supposed to search for a user's past purchases based on their name. However, it incorrectly"

21,11110000,2022-08-28,73516495,"Let's break down the problem to determine its difficulty level.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The user wants to move an image (enemy) smoothly in a Pygame application without leaving a trail behind it.
2. **Identifying the Issue**: The issue is likely due to not clearing or updating the screen properly before drawing new positions of the enemy, which results in a trail effect.

**Difficulty Level Analysis**:

112,11110000,2022-08-28,73521166,"The difficulty level of this question is 2.

Reasoning: The question requires understanding of basic Python concepts such as lists and indexing, as well as the csv module. However, it also involves a subtle issue with the timing of when the data is available in the list, which may require some thought to resolve. Additionally, the error message ""IndexError: list index out of range"" can be misleading if not understood correctly. Therefore, I would rate this question as moderately difficult (level 2"
