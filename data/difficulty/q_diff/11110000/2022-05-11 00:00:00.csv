This function is a blocking function and will wait for the buffer to be filled before returning, which can cause your GUI to freeze.

To fix this issue, you should use non-blocking functions to read data from the serial port. Here's an example of how you can modify your `serial_data()` function:

1. The user is trying to connect a Python application running in a Docker container to a PostgreSQL database also running in a Docker container.
