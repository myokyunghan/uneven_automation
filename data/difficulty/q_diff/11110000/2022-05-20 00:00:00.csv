1. **Script Complexity**: The provided Python script is quite complex, involving automation with Adobe Photoshop using `win32com.client`. It includes functions for resizing layers, translating them, and handling different types of textures based on their names. This level of interaction with an external application (Photoshop) and the manipulation of its elements (layers, documents) indicates a high level of complexity.
