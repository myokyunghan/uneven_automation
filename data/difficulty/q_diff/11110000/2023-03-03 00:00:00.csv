13,11110000,2023-03-03,75622629,"Let's break down the question into its components:

1. The user is experiencing an issue with tkinter where the children widgets are not recognizing their parent.
2. The user has provided a minimal block of code that reproduces the issue.
3. The user has tried different approaches, such as setting the master and using grids, but the issue persists.

To solve this question, one would need to have advanced knowledge of tkinter and its inner workings, particularly with regards to widget hierarchies and parent-child"
