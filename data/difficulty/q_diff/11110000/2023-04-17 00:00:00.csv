22,11110000,2023-04-17,76033717,"Let's break down the problem and analyze its components.

1. The user is trying to calculate the multinomial probability values for a trinomial expansion.
2. They have already implemented a function to calculate the binomial probability values.
3. They are trying to modify this function to work with trinomial expansions, but are having trouble getting the correct output.

The problem requires knowledge of:

* Multinomial probability theory
* Python programming (specifically, list comprehensions and function calls)
