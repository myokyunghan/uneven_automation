1. **Context**: The question involves a trading bot using the Binance API for cryptocurrency transactions.
2. **Problem Statement**: The user is experiencing an issue where their bot attempts to sell an asset, but the `get_balance()` function shows zero balance immediately after a filled buy order, resulting in an ""insufficient balance"" error.
3. **Code Complexity**: The provided code snippet involves:

35,11110000,2023-11-08,77443014,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The code provided implements a simple decoder-only transformer for text completion tasks.
2. The issue is that the attention mechanism attends to future tokens, which is not expected behavior.
3. The author has already checked the attention mask and believes it might not be related to the attention mechanism itself.

To solve this problem, one needs to have advanced knowledge of transformers, attention mechanisms, and PyTorch. The question requires analyzing the code, understanding how"
