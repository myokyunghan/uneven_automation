Reasoning: The question requires some knowledge of Django Rest Framework (DRF) and its serializer functionality. The user wants to know if there's a way to specify optional fields in the serializer meta class, which indicates they have some understanding of how serializers work in DRF. However, the solution might require some research or experimentation with different approaches, as it's not immediately clear from the documentation whether this is possible. Therefore, I would rate the difficulty"
