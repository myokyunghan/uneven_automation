1. **Understanding the Problem**: The question involves a Python web server using `http.server` and streaming data to clients. The issue is that when a client disconnects, the server doesn't detect this disconnection and continues sending data indefinitely. This requires understanding of how HTTP connections work and the specifics of implementing a streaming endpoint.

2. **Technical Complexity**: The solution involves dealing with socket programming (setting timeouts, using `select()` to"
