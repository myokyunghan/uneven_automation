This error can occur when the model is not properly defined or when there are issues with the computation of gradients during backpropagation.

To solve this issue, you should check the following:

1. Make sure that all layers in your model have been properly initialized and added to the model.

1. **Understanding GridSearchCV**: The user is trying to use `GridSearchCV` from scikit-learn for hyperparameter tuning on a logistic regression model within a pipeline that includes preprocessing steps.

2. **Error Analysis**: The error message indicates that one or more of the test scores are non-finite, specifically NaN (Not a Number). This usually points to an issue with the data or the model's ability to handle certain conditions"
