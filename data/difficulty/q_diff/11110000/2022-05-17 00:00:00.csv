This question requires advanced knowledge of deep learning and Keras. The error message is quite long and complex, but it ultimately points to a mismatch between the expected output shape of a convolutional transpose layer and the actual output shape.

To solve this problem, one would need to carefully examine the architecture of the model, particularly the convolutional transpose layers, and ensure that the output shapes are correctly specified. This may involve checking the documentation for the Keras Conv2DTranspose"
