1. **Understanding the Task**: The user wants to schedule a Python script using Windows Task Scheduler. This involves understanding how to interact with the operating system (Windows) from Python, which is an intermediate-level concept.

2. **Script Complexity**: The scripts themselves involve file operations (reading and writing Excel files and editing HTML files), which are basic to intermediate concepts in Python programming.

3. **Path References and"

135,11110000,2023-04-19,76059327,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The code is using asyncio to create a peer-to-peer node that can forward requests to other nodes.
2. The issue arises when a node forwards a request back to the node that it received the request from, causing a task to be cancelled with a ""Task was destroyed but it is pending!"" error.
3. The error occurs when trying to read from the reader provided by asyncio.start_server.
