70,11110000,2023-11-06,77432114,"Let's break down the problem and analyze its components to determine the appropriate difficulty level.

1. **XML Parsing**: The code provided uses `xml.etree.ElementTree` for parsing an XML file. This is a standard Python library, and using it requires basic knowledge of XML structure and how to navigate through elements.
2. **Error Handling**: The error encountered (`ParseError: not well-formed (invalid token)`) suggests that the issue might be related to the XML file itself rather than the code"
