1. The user wants to build an endpoint with Server-Sent Events (SSE) using FastAPI.
2. They are using trio and nurseries to run multiple tasks asynchronously.
3. They want to return the results of each task via the SSE endpoint as soon as it finishes.

The question requires knowledge of:

* Asynchronous programming in Python
* Trio library for concurrency
* FastAPI framework
* Server-Sent Events (SSE"
