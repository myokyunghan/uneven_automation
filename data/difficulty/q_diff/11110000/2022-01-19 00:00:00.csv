The `PYTHON3_LIBRARY` variable should point to the Python library file (`.lib`), but it seems like CMake or the build process is looking for an object file (`.obj`) instead.

To resolve this, you can try one of the following approaches:

1. **Specify the library name without extension**: Try setting `PYTHON3_LIBRARY` to just `%CONDA_PREFIX%/libs"
