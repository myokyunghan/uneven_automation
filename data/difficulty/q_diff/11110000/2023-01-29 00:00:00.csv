21,11110000,2023-01-29,75272527,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The error message ""TypeError: string indices must be integers"" indicates that there is an issue with indexing a string using another string.
2. The line causing the error is `experiment_status =  api_response['status']['experiment']['containerRecords'][0]['phase']`.
3. Upon closer inspection, it appears that `api_response` is not a dictionary as expected, but rather a string.
4. This suggests that the `get_names"

Reasoning:

1. The user has already successfully obtained an access token and client ID, indicating a good understanding of the authentication process.
2. The error message ""This endpoint requires at least one of the following scopes: profile, eats.pos_provisioning, profile.internal_uuid"" suggests that the issue is with the scope of the access token, which is a common problem in API authentication.
3. The user has tried appending the ""profile"" scope"

1. **Understanding the task**: The user is trying to adapt a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) code to work with their custom dataset instead of the MNIST dataset used in the original code.
2. **Error analysis**: The error message ""ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)"" indicates that there's an issue with the way data is being loaded or processed.
