1. The user is trying to read data from a Firebird database using Python.
2. They are encountering issues with handling class 'bytes' when reading data.
3. They have tried various methods, including decoding with utf-8, latin-1, and returning the value as is, but are still experiencing errors.

Based on these points, I would classify this question as Advanced (Difficulty Level 2). The user is dealing"
56,11110000,2023-01-26,75246514,"Let's break down the problem and analyze its components:

1. **Database Interaction**: The code interacts with a Firebird database using the `fdb` library. This requires knowledge of database concepts and how to use a specific library for interaction.

2. **Data Types and Handling**: The question revolves around handling different data types, especially bytes, which are not directly JSON serializable. It involves understanding how Python handles bytes, decoding them, and converting them into a format that can be serialized by JSON.
