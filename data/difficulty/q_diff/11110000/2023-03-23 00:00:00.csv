The user has already compiled and installed OpenSSL successfully, but is having trouble compiling Python with the custom OpenSSL installation. This requires some knowledge of compilation flags and dependencies, as well as troubleshooting skills to identify the issue. However, the error message provides a clear indication of what's missing (OpenSSL 1.1.1 or newer), so it's not an extremely difficult problem to solve.
