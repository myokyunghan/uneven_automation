76,11110000,2023-09-13,77097235,"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine its difficulty level.

1. **Understanding the Context**: The question involves a producer-consumer architecture using RabbitMQ (message broker) and Python with various libraries like `aio_pika` for asynchronous communication, `TortoiseORM` for database operations, and `FastAPI`. This setup indicates a moderate to high complexity due to the involvement of multiple technologies.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: The consumer only receives every second message,"
