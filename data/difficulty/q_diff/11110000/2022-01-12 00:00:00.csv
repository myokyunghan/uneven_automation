In your case, it seems like the output values are being scaled differently in the TensorFlow model and the TensorFlow Lite model. The TensorFlow model outputs probabilities between 0 and 1, while the TensorFlow Lite model outputs values that need to be divided by 255 to get the actual probabilities.
