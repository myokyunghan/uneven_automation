2,11110000,2022-05-07,72148559,"The difficulty level of this question is 2 because it requires some knowledge of Pydantic and datamodel-code-generator, as well as understanding of object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism. The question also involves a specific use case and requires the ability to analyze and debug code. However, the question is still relatively focused and does not require a broad range of knowledge or complex problem-solving skills, which is why it is not rated higher.
